The ReZoom team is currently looking for a <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> student at UMD who is skilled at 3D printing, CAD, and mechanical design. We require sturdy mounts for sensors and other pieces onto the scooter. 

Examples of what we need:
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/news/arduino.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/news/jetson.jpeg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/news/ODrive.jpeg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Three examples of unfulfilled tasks. Flimsy Arduino mount (Left), insecure Jetson Computer mount (Middle), No way to mount ODrive to scooter base (Right)
</div>

>Please email Dr. Paley at dpaley@umd.edu if you feel you might fulfill these requirements!
